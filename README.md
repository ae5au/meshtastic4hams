Presentation on Meshtastic geared toward amateur radio operators

## What is Meshtastic?
An open source, off-grid, decentralized, mesh network built to run on affordable, low-power devices.

* Luke's additions
    * Text-based communications
        * Direct & group messaging.
        * Position and telemetry reporting
        * Bots and some others
        * NOT talking voice, video, or browsing the web.
    * Mostly unlicensed ISM bands - 900MHz in US
        * Can be used in a licensed mode.
    * LoRa
        * Similar to FT8 in working below noise floor.
* Open source
    * Code is freely available
* Off grid, decentralized
    * Doesn't depend on the internet, a central server, registry, etc.
    * Can be stood up in the middle of nowhere with no connection to an existing network.
* Mesh network
    * Wikipedia: A mesh network is a network topology in which the nodes connect directly, dynamically and non-hierarchically to as many other nodes as possible and cooperate with one another to efficiently route data to and from clients.
    * Maybe a stretch, but basically the focus is that most nodes contribute to extending the network and it can function without much planning.
* Affordable devices
    * Devices range from $20 ~ $100.
    * Many options for 3D printed cases and DIY builds.
    * Also options for hardware that is ready out-of-the-box.

## Why?

* Neighborhood
* Outdoor activities
* Metro or larger area

## How?

* Buy/build node
    * General guidance on nodes. Power, Wi-Fi, etc.
* Flash firmware
* Tips
    * Maybe info on what (not) to do, etc.

## Hardware
* Show various hardware options
* Discuss phone app and how app/node relationship works.

## Other
* Comparisons to APRS
* LoRa-APRS and other similar things
